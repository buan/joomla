Once the articles are created, we need to format them
1)By default we use wysiwig editor to format our data
2)We have a field called tags..Other than categories,you can also classify your content with tags.Write something and it automatically gets created.For joomla overview article, we have used climate and overview as tag words
3)Go to publishing tab, and in publishing options,we have start publishing and finish publishing.A article has finish publishing data which means that after that date it will not be seen published
4)Under content tab,there is a toggle editor button at the bottom
